                It allows administrators to view the dashboard and see the status of the jobs and

            <p class="p">IBM StoredIQ Administrator helps you manage global assets common to the distributed
                infrastructure behind IBM StoredIQ applications.</p>
            <img class="image" src="../../resources/images/IBM_StoredIQ_Administrator.jpg" width="760" />
            <p class="p">IBM StoredIQ Administrator provides at-a-glance understanding of the different issues
                that can crop up in the IBM StoredIQ environment. These views are unique to the IBM
                StoredIQ Administrator application as they provide an overview of how the system is
                running. They allow access to various pieces of information that are being shared
                across applications or allow for the management of resources in a centralized
                manner.</p>
            <p class="p">The administrator is the person responsible for managing the IBM StoredIQ. This
                individual has strong understanding of data sources, indexes, data servers, jobs,
                infosets, and actions. This list provides an overview as to how IBM StoredIQ
                Administrator works: </p>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">
                    <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Viewing data servers and volumes: </strong>Using IBM StoredIQ Administrator,
                        the Administrator can identify what data servers are deployed, their
                        location, what data is being managed, and the status of each data server in
                        the system. Volume management is a central component of IBM StoredIQ. IBM
                        StoredIQ Administrator also allows the Administrator to see what volumes are
                        currently under management, which data server is responsible for that
                        volume, the state of the volume after indexing, and the amount and size of
                        information that is contained by each volume. Administrators can also add
                        volumes to and delete volumes from data servers through this interface.</p>
                    <p class="p">If IBM StoredIQ is con³gured for integration with Information Governance
                        Catalog, the Administrator can also manage which volumes are published to
                        the governance catalog.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Scheduling harvests: </strong>Harvesting, which can also be referred to as
                    indexing, is the process or task by which IBM StoredIQ examines and classifies
                    data in your network. Using IBM StoredIQ Administrator, harvests can be
                    scheduled, edited, and deleted.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Creating system infosets: </strong>System infosets that use only speci³c indexed
                    volumes can be created and managed within IBM StoredIQ Administrator. Although
                    infosets are a core component of IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench, system infosets
                    are created as a shortcut for users in IBM StoredIQ Administrator.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Managing users:</strong> The user management area allows administrators to create
                    users and manage users' access to the various IBM StoredIQ applications</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Configuring and managing actions: </strong>An action is any process that is taken
                    upon the data that is represented by the indexes. Actions are run by data
                    servers on indexed data objects. Any errors or warnings that are generated as a
                    result of an action are recorded as exceptions in IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench.
                        <div class="note note note_note"><span class="note__title">Note:</span> Actions can be created within IBM StoredIQ Administrator and then made
                        available to other IBM StoredIQ applications such as IBM StoredIQ Data
                        Workbench.</div></li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Managing target sets:</strong>Provides an interface that allows the user to set
                    the wanted targets for specific actions that require a destination volume for
                    their actions.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Reports:</strong> IBM StoredIQ Administrator provides a number of built-in
                    reports, such as summaries of data objects in the system, storage use, and the
                    number of identical documents in the system. You can create custom reports,
                    including Query Analysis Reports for e-discovery purposes, and automatically
                    email report notifictions to administrators and other interested parties.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Auto-classification:</strong> Automated document categorization, what <span class="keyword apiname">IBM
                        StoredIQ</span> refers to as auto-classification models, integrates the
                    IBM® Content Classification's classification model into the <span class="keyword apiname">IBM
                        StoredIQ</span> infoset-generation process. Data Experts can use IBM
                    Content Classification to train a classification model, which is then registered
                    with IBM StoredIQ Administrator. The registered classification model can be
                    applied to an existing infoset in IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench to generate new
                    metadata for the objects in the infoset. Metadata can be used in rule-based
                    filters to create new infosets</li>
                <li class="li">
                    <strong class="ph b">Cartridges:</strong> Cartridges are compressed ³les that contain analysis logic.
                    When you add a cartridge to IBM StoredIQ AppStack, it can detect new data in
                    documents during indexing and make these new insights searchable. For example, a
                    sensitive pattern cartridge can enable IBM StoredIQ to detect passport numbers,
                    phone numbers, and other IDs. <p class="p"> To apply the analysis logic contained in the
                        cartridge, you must run a Step-up Analytics action that uses the cartridge
                        on an infoset. IBM StoredIQ examines all documents in the infoset, applies
                        the analytics, and then stores the analysis results in the IBM StoredIQ
                        index</p>

                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Managing concepts:</strong> Provides the ability to relate business concepts to
                    indexed data.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Managing Mule scripts:</strong> Helps you to create Mule scripts and upload script

                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b"> DataServer - Classic:</strong> Data servers can be categorized in two types:
                    DataServer - Classic and DataServer - Distributed. DataServer - Classic refers
                    to the regular data servers. It uses either the current PostgreSQL or Lucene
                    index as an index. </li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">DataServer - Distributed:</strong> The distributed data server uses an
                    Elasticsearch cluster instead of an embedded Postgres database. It increases the
                    scalability and flexibility of the IBM StoredIQ deployment in a way that it can
                    manage much larger amounts of data. Without adding more data servers, data that
                    is managed by the IBM StoredIQ deployment can be increased by adding new nodes
                    to the Elasticsearch cluster. Search queries perform better on DataServer -
                    Distributed.</li>
                <li class="li"><strong class="ph b">Connector API SDK:</strong> A connector is a software component of IBM StoredIQ
                    that is used to connect to a data source such as a network ³le system and access
                    its data. Using IBM StoredIQ Connector API SDK, developers of other companies
                    can develop connectors to new data sources outside the IBM StoredIQ development
                    environment. These connectors can be integrated with a live IBM StoredIQ
                    application to index, search, manage, and analyze data on the data source.</li>

            <p class="p">Big data is a pervasive problem, not a one-time occurrence. It is easy for most
                companies to realize that big data is problematic, but it is hard to identify what
                problems they have. Big data is all about the unknown, but the unknown cannot be off
                limits. IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench can help you learn about your data, make
                educated decisions with your most valuable asset, and turn your company's most
                dangerous risk into its most valuable asset.</p>
            <img class="image" src="../../resources/images/IBM_StoredIQ_Data_Workbench.jpg" width="760" />
            <p class="p">IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench is a data visualization and management tool that helps
                you to actively manage your company's data. It helps you to determine how much data
                you have, where it is, who owns it, and when it was last used. When you have a clear
                understanding of your company's data landscape, IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench helps
                you take control of data. You can make informed decisions about your data and act on
                that knowledge by copying, copying to retention, or conducting a discovery export. </p>
            <p class="p">Here are just some examples of how you can use IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench.</p>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">You need to find all company email that is sent from or received by Eileen
                    Sideways (esideways@thecompany.com). You can use IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench to
                    find all email and then copy that data to a predefined repository. You can also
                    use IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench to find all of the esideways@thecompany.com
                    email that occurred between specific dates and then make that email available
                    for review</li>
                <li class="li">As an administrator, you want to rid your networks and storage of unused data.
                    You can use IBM StoredIQ Data Workbench to find all files that were not modi³ed
                    in more than five years.</li>
                <li class="li">You want to find all image ³les that are created in 2007. Not only can IBM
                    StoredIQ Data Workbench find all image files that were created in 2007. It also
                    shows how much space they occupy on your network.</li>
                <li class="li">A user needs to understand how data about Windows is being retained. Using IBM
                    StoredIQ Data Workbench, you can provide that user with a visual overview of the
                    number of objects that are retained and a breakdown of files per data source.
                    Additionally, you can apply overlays to show the user if those files contain
                    forbidden information such as credit-card numbers or Social Security
                    numbers.</li>
                <li class="li">If IBM StoredIQ is configured accordingly, you can select the infosets and
                    filters that are published to the governance catalog for uni³ed governance of
                    structured and unstructured information. When integrating with Information
                    Governance Catalog, you can also analyze and classify the data governed by IBM
                    StoredIQ based on the data classes that are synchronized from the governance
                    catalog.</li>
