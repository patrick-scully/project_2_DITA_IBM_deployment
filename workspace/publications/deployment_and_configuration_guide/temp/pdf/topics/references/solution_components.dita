A
                data server of the type DataServer - Classic uses the embedded PostgreSQL database for storing the
                index. With a data server of the type DataServer - Distributed, the index is stored in an Elasticsearch
                cluster. Data servers of this type also provide better performance in search queries. They can manage
                much larger amounts of data than data servers of the type DataServer - Classic, thus making the IBM
                StoredIQ deployments more scalable..</p>
